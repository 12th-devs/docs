## **How do I know Zen is safe?**

Zen Browser is designed with a focus on security and privacy. Additionally, the browser's codebase is derived from Firefox, a well-known and trusted open-source project. Users can verify the safety of the browser by reviewing the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop) and by noting that it has been tested and certified as free of viruses and malware by various antivirus programs. Regular updates and community engagement also contribute to its security.

## **How to switch tabs by scrolling?**
To switch tabs by scrolling in Zen Browser, you need to enable this feature by changing a setting in the browser's configuration. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open the `about:config` page**: Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. This page contains advanced settings for the browser.
2. **Search for `toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling`**: In the search bar on the `about:config` page, type `toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling`.
3. **Change the setting to `true`**: When the setting appears, double-click on it to toggle the value from `false` to `true`.

Once this setting is enabled, you can hover your mouse over the tab bar and use your mouse wheel to scroll through the tabs, making it easier to navigate between them.

## **Where do I recommend features?**

If you want to recommend features or report an issue in Zen Browser, you can do so via the browser's GitHub page. Before submitting your request, it's mandatory to first check if the issue or feature has already been reported. You can do this by searching through existing issues on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues).

Keep in mind that the Zen Browser team is currently very small, so it might take some time for your request to be reviewed and addressed. The team is dedicated to improving the browser, but with limited resources, they prioritize the most critical and popular requests. Your patience and thoroughness in reporting can help make Zen Browser better for everyone.

## **How can I sync my data across multiple devices?**

Zen Browser integrates with Firefox Sync, allowing you to sync your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other browser data across multiple devices. To enable Firefox Sync in Zen Browser:

1. **Open Zen Browser Settings**: Go to `about:preferences` or click on the settings icon.
2. **Navigate to the "Sync" tab**: In the settings menu, find the "Sync" tab where you can manage sync options.
3. **Sign in with your Firefox Account**: If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one. Once signed in, you can choose what data you want to sync.
4. **Start Syncing**: After signing in and selecting your preferences, your data will be synced across all devices where you have Zen Browser installed and signed in with the same Firefox account.

This feature ensures that your browsing experience remains consistent across different devices, making it easy to pick up where you left off.
