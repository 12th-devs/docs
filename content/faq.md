<summary>How can I use horizontal tabs?</summary>

Zen Browser will not support horizontal tabs in the near future. The decision to focus on **Vertical Tabs** is a core design choice, with the entire Zen Browser experience built around this concept. This approach is intended to maximize screen space and improve navigation, making vertical tabs an essential part of Zen's philosophy.

<summary>Will there be a mobile version for Zen Browser?</summary>

At the moment, our team does not have the time or resources to develop Android or iOS versions of Zen Browser. Additionally, we believe that Zen‚Äôs unique features, particularly its design around vertical tabs, do not translate well to the mobile form factor. As such, we do not currently have plans to develop a mobile version of Zen Browser.

<summary>Why can't Zen Browser play DRM-protected content?</summary>

> [!important] This only affects Microsoft Windows and MacOS

> [!question]- What is DRM?  
> [Digital Rights Management](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM) is a technology used to control how digital content, such as videos and music, can be accessed and used. DRM is commonly used by streaming services to protect copyrighted content. When you try to play DRM-protected content, the website verifies if the necessary DRM software is available on your browser. Most browsers use [**Widevine**](https://www.widevine.com), a DRM technology developed by Google, to facilitate this.

Zen Browser currently lacks DRM support because it does not have a Widevine license. Acquiring such a license requires the payment of large fees (at least $5,000), which is financially unfeasible for the developer of Zen. This means that DRM-protected media cannot be played in Zen Browser for the foreseeable future. If support grows and the developer receives sufficient funding, a Widevine license may be considered.

Feel free to support the funding of a Widevine license for Zen on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/zen_browser) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/zen_browser)!

> [!question]- Which Services Are Affected?  
> Due to the lack of DRM support, you will not be able to stream content from the following services in Zen Browser:  
> - **HBO Max**  
> - **Netflix**  
> - **Spotify**  
> - **Disney+**  
> - **Amazon Prime Video**  
> - **Apple Music**  
> - **Google Play Movies & TV**  
> - **And possibly other services that use DRM not listed here**

> [!info] Alternative solutions  
> - Use a browser that has a Widevine license, such as [**Mozilla Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), when streaming DRM-protected content.  
> - Use the native desktop app for the service you want to use

<summary>Where do I recommend features?</summary>

If you want to recommend features or report an issue, you can do so on the browser's GitHub page. Before submitting your request, it's mandatory to check if the issue or feature has already been reported. You can do this by searching through existing issues on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues).

Keep in mind that the Zen Browser team is currently very small, so it might take some time for your request to be reviewed and addressed. The team is dedicated to improving the browser, but with limited resources, they prioritize the most critical and popular requests. Your patience and thoroughness in reporting can help make Zen Browser better for everyone.
