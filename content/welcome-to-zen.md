# Welcome to Zen!

If you've recently updated Zen after a significant version jump, I recommend creating a new profile. You can do this by clicking the button in the bottom-left corner and selecting the option to create a new profile.

## Cool New Improvements in Zen:

## Better Themes:

You can change the gradient by right-clicking on the sidebar and clicking ”Change Theme Colors.” You can also add custom colors via hex codes or other color formats.

## Zen Glance:

This opens links in a mini tab (this can be especially useful because you can open bookmarks from the top bar in Glance). If you want to swap the modifier key used to activate Glance you can go to settings under “Look and Feel”.

## New Tab Organization:

There is now an option for the URL in the sidebar (We also made this work with Windows even). Tabs are now organized into 3 categories.

- Essentials (the square ones at the top)
- Pinned (these are workspace specific)
- Normal tabs (parenthesis cuz symmetry)

## Split View:

Split view now has options for resizing the splits as well as rearranging split view items. You can split more than 20 tabs in one split view at a time (this is insane but Arc limited me to 4 even on a widescreen).
