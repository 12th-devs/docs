## Zen URL bar

Zen Browser’s **URL bar** is a powerful tool that helps you navigate the web quickly and efficiently. There's no need to open a new tab or window to search the web—simply type your query into the URL bar and hit Enter to search. The URL bar also supports direct navigation to websites, so you can type a URL and press Enter to visit the site directly.

* Can be disabled in settings or `about:config` (`zen.urlbar.replace-newtab`)
