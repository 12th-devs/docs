Based on Firefox, Zen also inherit its translation features, allowing you navigate websites in various language easily. The translation process are done locally on your device, instead of relying in cloud services. You can translate a whole page, translate a specific text selection, or translated a specific link!

Zen detects the page languages manually and will suggest to translate it to your preferred languages. You can use the "**Translate from**" dropdown menu to change page language to detect, and use the "**Translate to**" dropdown menu to change your translation output language. Click "**Translate**" to translate the entire page.

Zen will download the language first if you're using this feature for the first time. After the language is downloaded, translation process will take around 20-60 seconds, depend on the length of contents.

The **Translate button** in URL bar will be updated along with the translation process, and after the translation process gets completed, your preferred language will be shown beside the icon.
