Based on Firefox, Zen also inherit its translation features, allowing you navigate websites in various language easily. The translation process are done locally on your device, instead of relying in cloud services. You can translate a whole page, translate a specific text selection, or translated a link text!

### Translating the full page

When you visit a webpage in a supported language, the translation panel will popped up automatically. You can also do it manually by opening **Main Menu** button and selecting **Translate page** option.

You can also use a dedicated Translate button in the right side of the URL bar, which shows up when visiting webpages outside of your preferred language. In Single Toolbar mode, the button will be hidden by default and can be accessed after clicking the URL bar.

Zen detects the page languages manually and will suggest to translate it to your preferred languages. You can use the "**Translate from**" dropdown menu to change page language to detect, and use the "**Translate to**" dropdown menu to change your translation output language. Select "**Translate**" to translate the entire page.

Zen will download the language first if you're using this feature for the first time. After the language is downloaded, translation process will take around 20-60 seconds, depend on the length of contents.

The **Translate button** in URL bar will be updated along with the translation process, and after the translation process gets completed, your preferred language will be shown beside the icon. 

To revert the page to the original language, click the Translate button in the URL bar and select "**Show original**".
