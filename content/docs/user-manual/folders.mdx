# Folders

Folders let you organize your tabs into manageable groups, helping you keep your workspace clean and focused.

## Creating a Folder

You can create a folder in two ways:

1. **From a Tab**  
   Right-click on any tab and select **"Add to folder"** to group it into a new or existing folder.

2. **From the Toolbar**  
   Right-click on any empty space in the toolbar and choose **"New folder"**.

## Using Folders

- All folders appear in the **pinned tabs container**.
- You can **drag tabs** into a folder.
- You can **drag folders around** to rearrange them.
- You can also **drag folders into other folders** to create nested folders.

## Features

### Nested folders

Nested folders are a great way to organize related projects or workflows with multiple levels of detail.

This has far many more use cases, feel free to explore and experiment with it.
